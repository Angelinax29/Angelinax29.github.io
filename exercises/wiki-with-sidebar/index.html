                <p>
                    <b>The Simpsons</b> is an American animated sitcom created 
                    by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company.
                    <sup>[1][2][3]</sup> Developed by Groening, James L. Brooks,
                    and Sam Simon, the series is a satirical depiction of
                    American life, epitomized by the Simpson family, which 
                    consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Set in 
                    the fictional town of Springfield, it caricatures society,
                    Western culture, television, and the human condition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a 
                    solicitation for a series of animated shorts with producer
                    Brooks. He created a dysfunctional family and named the 
                    characters after his own family members, substituting Bart
                    for his own name; he thought Simpson was a funny name in 
                    that it sounded similar to "simpleton".<sup>[4]</sup> The 
                    shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on 
                    April 19, 1987. After three seasons, the sketch was 
                    developed into a half-hour prime time show and became 
                    Fox's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a 
                    season (1989–1990).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Simpsons received widespread acclaim throughout its 
                    early seasons in the 1990s, which are generally considered 
                    its "golden age". Since then, it has been criticized for a 
                    perceived decline in quality. Time named it the 20th 
                    century's best television series,[9] and Erik Adams of The 
                    A.V. Club named it "television's crowning achievement 
                    regardless of format".<sup>[10]</sup> On January 14, 2000, 
                    the Simpson family was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk 
                    of Fame. It has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a 
                    series, including 37 Primetime Emmy Awards, 34 Annie Awards,
                    and 2 Peabody Awards. Homer's exclamatory catchphrase of 
                    "D'oh!" has been adopted into the English language, while 
                    The Simpsons has influenced many other later adult-oriented
                    animated sitcom television series.

                <p>
                    The main characters are the Simpson family, who live in the 
                    fictional "Middle America" town of Springfield.
                    <sup>[11]</sup> Homer, the father, works as a safety 
                    inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position
                    at odds with his careless, buffoonish personality. He is 
                    married to Marge (née Bouvier), a stereotypical American 
                    housewife and mother. They have three children: Bart, a 
                    ten-year-old troublemaker and prankster; Lisa, a precocious 
                    eight-year-old activist; and Maggie, the baby of the family 
                    who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a 
                    pacifier. Although the family is dysfunctional, many 
                    episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each 
                    other and they are often shown to care about one another.

                <p>
                    The show includes a vast array of quirky supporting 
                    characters, which include Homer's friends Barney Gumble, 
                    Lenny Leonard and Carl Carlson; the school principal Seymour
                    Skinner and staff members such as Edna Krabappel and 
                    Groundskeeper Willie; students such as Milhouse Van Houten,
                    Nelson Muntz and Ralph Wiggum; shopkeepers such as Apu 
                    Nahasapeemapetilon, Comic Book Guy and Moe Szyslak; 
                    government figures Mayor "Diamond" Joe Quimby and Clancy 
                    Wiggum; next-door neighbor Ned Flanders; local celebrities
                    such as Krusty the Clown and news reporter Kent Brockman
                    nuclear tycoon Montgomery Burns and his devoted 
                    assistant Waylon Smithers; and dozens more.

                <h3 class="sub"><i>Floating Timeline</i></h3>
                <p>
                    The series uses a floating timeline in which episodes 
                    generally take place in the year the episode is produced. 
                    Flashbacks and flashforwards do occasionally depict the 
                    characters at other points in their lives, with the timeline
                    of these depictions also generally floating relative to the
                    year the episode is produced. For example, the 1991 
                    episodes <i>"The Way We Was"</i> and 
                    <i>"I Married Marge"</i> depict Homer and Marge as high 
                    schoolers in the 1970s who had Bart 
                    (who is always 10 years old) in the early '80s, while the 
                    2008 episode "That '90s Show" depicts Homer and Marge as a 
                    childless couple in the '90s, and the 2021 episode 
                    <i>"Do Pizza Bots Dream of Electric Guitars"</i> portrays 
                    Homer as an adolescent in the same period. 
                </p>
                <h3 class="sub"><i>Setting</i></h3>
                <p>
                    The Simpsons takes place in a fictional American town called
                    <i>Springfield</i>. Although there are many real settlements 
                    in America named Springfield,<sup>[16]</sup> the town the 
                    show is set in is fictional. The state it is in is not 
                    established. In fact, the show is intentionally evasive with
                    regard to Springfield's location.

                    When producer James L. Brooks was working on the television 
                    variety show The Tracey Ullman Show, he decided to include 
                    small animated sketches before and after the commercial 
                    breaks. Having seen one of cartoonist Matt Groening's Life 
                    in Hell comic strips, Brooks asked Groening to pitch an idea
                    for a series of animated shorts. Groening initially 
                    intended to present an animated version of his Life in Hell 
                    series.<sup>[22]</sup> However, Groening later realized that
                    animating Life in Hell would require the rescinding of 
                    publication rights for his life's work. He therefore chose
                    another approach while waiting in the lobby of Brooks's 
                    office for the pitch meeting, hurriedly formulating his 
                    version of a dysfunctional family that became the Simpsons.
                    <sup>[22][23]</sup> He named the characters after his own 
                    family members, substituting "Bart" for his own name, 
                    adopting an anagram of the word brat.<sup>[22]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Simpson family first appeared as shorts in The Tracey 
                    Ullman Show on April 19, 1987.[24] Groening submitted only 
                    basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures
                    would be cleaned up in production. However, the animators 
                    merely re-traced his drawings, which led to the crude 
                    appearance of the characters in the initial shorts.
                    <sup>[22]</sup> The animation was produced domestically at 
                    lasky Csupo,<sup>[25][26]</sup> with Wes Archer, David 
                    Silverman, and Bill Kopp being animators for the first 
                    season.<sup>[27]</sup> The colorist, "Georgie" Gyorgyi 
                    Kovacs Peluce <i>(Kovács Györgyike)</i>
                    <sup>[28][29][30][31][32][33]</sup> made the characters 
                    yellow; as Bart, Lisa and Maggie have no hairlines, she 
                    felt they would look strange if they were flesh-colored. 
                    Groening supported the decision, saying: "Marge is yellow 
                    with blue hair? That's hilarious — let's do it!"
                    <sup>[27]</sup>

                    The Simpsons uses the standard setup of a situational 
                    comedy, or sitcom, as its premise. The series centers on a 
                    family and their life in a typical American town,
                    <sup>[11]</sup> serving as a satirical parody of a middle 
                    class American lifestyle.<sup>[93]</sup> However, because 
                    of its animated nature, The Simpsons' scope is larger than
                    that of a regular sitcom. The town of Springfield acts as a 
                    complete universe in which characters can explore the issues
                    faced by modern society. By having Homer work in a nuclear 
                    power plant, the show can comment on the state of the 
                    environment.<sup>[94]</sup> Through Bart and Lisa's days at
                    Springfield Elementary School, the show's writers 
                    illustrate pressing or controversial issues in the field of
                    education. The town features a vast array of television 
                    channels, which enables the producers to make jokes about 
                    the entertainment industry and the press.<sup>[95]</sup>
