                    Stitch was a genetic experiment created to be a weapon of 
                    mass destruction.  At the beginning of his story he is a 
                    villain and happy to be so.  He is unrepentant in his role 
                    as destroyer and escapes his captors to wreak havoc across 
                    the galaxy.  Then he meets Lilo, a little girl with tragedy 
                    in her past, serious anger management issues, and a real 
                    need for a friend.  Somehow Stitch becomes that friend.  
                    In the process of becoming what Lilo needs Stitch finds what
                    he needs as well.

                    As the movie progresses Stich moves from trying to destroy 
                    everything he touches to searching for his own family.  He 
                    comes to identify with the Ugly Duckling rather than 
                    Godzilla and discovers that family can be created as well as
                    given.  Honestly every time I hear the line about his 
                    family being, <i>"little and broken; but still good"</i>
                    I get a little teary.  Every time.

                    Lilo & Stich's story is the epitome of redemption.  
                    Two broken and damaged people find each other and through 
                    their (eventual) love of each other bring healing and 
                    wholeness.  The circle of family is drawn wide enough for 
                    everyone.  Everyone is loved for who they are and what they
                    add to the whole.  Perfection isn't expected, just 
                    connection.  And that brings hope to us all.

                    “OHANA MEANS FAMILY. FAMILY MEANS NOBODY GETS LEFT BEHIND. 
                    OR FORGOTTEN.”
                </h3>
                <p>
                    They both live together without their parents in Hawaii, but
                    them being separated from their parents does not mean they 
                    are not a family. Lilo states in the movie “Ohana means 
                    family, and family means nobody gets left behind or 
                    forgotten. This means that families will always be there 
                    even when we are separated.

                    Animated cartoons for children, especially long-form 
                    animations, are not only moral stories, they are almost 
                    always transparent in offering lessons in living — as Lilo 
                    & Stitch is, just read that brief description again. That's 
                    not a criticism; in fact, it's hard to even imagine an 
                    animated cartoon story for children that wasn't grounded in
                    a moral universe of some kind.
